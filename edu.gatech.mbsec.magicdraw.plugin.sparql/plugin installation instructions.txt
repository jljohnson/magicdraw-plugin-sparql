MagicDraw SPARQl plugin.

Tested with MagicDraw v18.0 SP1

Copy the "edu.gatech.mbse.magicdraw.sparql" folder
located in the "MagicDraw Plugin - Folder to copy into MD plugins directory" folder
into your MagicDraw plugins directory.

Example models will be added later.

Open a MagicDraw model containing constraints describing SPARQL queries

Select the constraint named "SPARQL Select Query: get values of source and target ports of item flows" 
(the one at the bottom of the list)


Right-click on the constraint and select "Execute SPARQL Design Rule"

You should then see details about the query and the query result in the MagicDraw notification window.
